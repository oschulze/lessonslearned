Here are some learnings associated with increasing productivy of employees
-Pairing the programmers: even though engineers working with the same computers can loose producitivy for basic tasks, when it comes to 
complex problems they tend to produce code with more quality than when working individually.
-Spending time on Slack: in this case, it is recommeded to limit time on Slack and have periods of time where engineers are not chatting.
Engineers need to be focused for long hours to be productive. 
-Talking vs. Coding: it is important that the manager of the team have a daily communication with the engineers. However, it is important
to manage the time spent on discussions or brainstorming and leave enough time for actual coding. 
-Co-location: this always helps, because engineers that work on teams can communicate more effectively. However, it is possible to have 
remote teams working productively. One potential probelms with remote teams is having different time-zones, which can become a problem if
you have more than 5-6 hours of differences. India is a very common location for hiring, and you cannot have overlap in the hours between 
engineers, which can be a huge problem. Another problem is 'cultural fit', whereby communication may be less efficient because of different 
cultural tradition (i.e. USA is more direct vs UK more indirect communication).
-Spending half a day of the week on 'free projects'. This can be a productive habit if managed correctly. Engineers need some time-off 
to think how things can be made differently, how to make a task they repeat a lot automatic, etc. Sometimes the short term necessities 
do not allow for the time to fix these issues that may be important in the medium term. Having Friday afternoon for this can be a good 
practice.
-Use of TDD (test driven development): this allows to write the code piece by piece and make sure it works. This is more efficient 
than getting to the end only to find out that there is an issue somewhere in the code that needs to be fixed.
